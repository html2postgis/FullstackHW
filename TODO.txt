1. Add map at the bottom of our page;
  *good CSS and HTML code with appropiate names
  
2. Consult the best geoapi that will fullfil 4 key problems:
-A: Free; it has to be free,
-B: Documentation; good documentation with plenty examples,
-C: Easy to implement; it should take much time to switch to new solution
-D: Verbose customization; plenty of map tiles,

Proposition 1:
-HERE Developer
  *general descrpition: 
    https://developer.here.com/develop/javascript-api
  *finding the nearest marker:
    https://developer.here.com/documentation/examples/maps-js/markers/finding-the-nearest-marker
    

Proposition 2:
-Plunker???
  *general descrpition: 
    link is the same as for solution. This solution is overdone(it shows nearest points with lines).
    But maybe we can take some code from it.
  *finding the nearest marker:

 #1 REMINDER:
  We already used one library/plugin/appi??? that uses gecoding(https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/reverse-geocoding.html),
  maybe some propositions(generally proposition number 1) would not need this solution.
